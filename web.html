            -	Browser presents content in a hierarchy called DOM. 
-	Document Object Model
-	It is a hierarchy used to present contents in HTML
What is Static DOM and Dynamic DOM? 
-	The DOM which is initially loaded by HTML is static. 
-	HTML can present static DOM. 
-	Static DOM can’t handle interactions.
-	JavaScript, jQuery, Angular JS, React etc. are used to convert the static DOM into dynamic DOM.
<pre>
    What is Element and What is Tag?
-	HTML presents using Elements.
-	Elements are built by using Tags. 
</p>
<pre>
    Example: &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    This div element represents an empty box that contains other elements.
    </pre>
    <pre>
        Example: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;
        In this example, "a" is tag and it's representing anchor element. It will be clicked when user clicks on Google link.
        In this example, "a" tag represents anchor element. It's not just text but it also includes attributes like href.
        In this example, "a" tag represents anchor link. It's not just text but it also includes URL information.
        In this example, "a" tag represents anchor element. It's an interactive element.

                    <h2>CSS</h2>
                    <p>
                        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It describes how HTML documents should be displayed on screen or printed.
                        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
                        It helps us style our web pages.
                        There are two types of selectors:
                        1.	Element Selector (tag name)
                        2.	Class Selector (.classname)
                        We use these selectors to apply styles on specific elements or classes.
                        Here is how we define a selector:
                        .selector {
                            property : value ;
                            }
                            For example:
                            p {
                                color : red ;
                                font-size : 30px ;
                                }
                                The above code will change the text color to red and size to 30px for all paragraph tags.
                                The above code will change all paragraph tags text color to red and size to 30 pixels.
                                The above code will change all paragraph tags text color to red and size to 30 pixels.
                                The above code will change the text color to red and size to 30px for all paragraph tags.
                                The above code will change the text color to red and size to 30px for all paragraph tags.
                                The above code will change all paragraph text color to red and size to 30 pixels.
                                The above code will change the text color to red and size to 30 pixels for all paragraph tags in your webpage.
                                The above code will change all paragraph text color to red and size to 30px.
                                Another way to write css is inline styling which is not recommended as it makes your HTML file messy.
                                Another way to write the same thing in css is as follows:
                                p {
                                    color : red !important ;
                                    font-size : 30px !important ;
                                    }
                                    The exclamation mark (!) at the end of important makes it more important than any other conflicting rules.
                                    In this case, important keyword makes sure that the properties are applied even if there are conflicting rules elsewhere in your CSS file.
                                    But using important keyword is not recommended because it overrides any other rules set before it.
                                    p {
                                        background-color : yellow;
                                        border : 5px solid black;
                                        padding : 10px;
                                        margin : 15px;
                                        width : 40%;
                                        height : auto;
                                        display : inline-block;
                                        }
                                        In this case, I have used important keyword which makes sure that the properties override any other conflicting rules.
                                    </p>
